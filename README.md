# GEN-AI-using-GAN

Gen AI - Image Generation using GAN
Gen AI is a project focused on generating CIFAR-10-like images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The custom GAN model consists of a Generator and a Discriminator, trained to produce realistic images and differentiate between real and generated ones.
Key Features
Trains a custom GAN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Generates images resembling CIFAR-10 images with unique variations.
Supports training and image generation via Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab.
Use Case
Data Augmentation: Augment existing datasets with synthetic images.
Concept Exploration: Explore novel concepts and artistic expressions.
Prototyping: Create mock-ups and test interfaces with generated images.
Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure dependencies are installed, including Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.
Training
Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Colab.
Run the notebook to train the GAN model.
Utilize GPU acceleration for faster training, especially on Google Colab.
Generation
After training, use the trained model to generate new images.
Experiment with different latent space values to explore image variations.
